# Wal-Mart
Code for first interview

## Assumptions/Restrictions:
* Every line on the entry file will have only 2 parts: a reservation name (R001) and the amount of seats (an integer)
* There is no priority for the buffer. Seating individuals 3 seats apart or 1 row apart is equally satisfiable
* An individual seated on an end needs no buffer seats beyond the end of the row (the 20th seat)
* The program will NOT attempt to process output if any input errors are existent
* An empty input will product an empty output file
